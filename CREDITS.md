## Payment gateway process

The merchant payment gateway in this project follows the hosted checkout process that card payment gateways use. Credit goes to Mastercard for documenting that process publicly in the **Mastercard Gateway – Hosted Checkout** integration guide:

| Step in the Mastercard guide                         | The same step in this project                                              |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The merchant's server starts a checkout session      | `POST /api/gateway/checkout-sessions` with the merchant's API key          |
| The payer is sent to a payment page the gateway hosts | The customer is redirected to the wallet's checkout page                   |
| The payer is returned to the merchant's return URL   | The customer is sent back to the session's `returnUrl`                     |
| The merchant's server retrieves the order to confirm | `GET /api/gateway/checkout-sessions/{sessionId}` before showing the result |
| The gateway sends webhook notifications              | Signed callbacks to the merchant's callback URL                            |

This project is not affiliated with Mastercard and does not use Mastercard's services or code. It pays from a wallet balance, not from a card.
