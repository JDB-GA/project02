# API reference

[← Back to the README](../README.md)

Interactive documentation with request/response schemas, status codes and examples: **`/swagger-ui.html`**. To try protected endpoints, call `POST /auth/users/login` first; the browser keeps the session cookie.

Base URLs: `http://localhost:8080` in development and `https://api.almotawaj.com` in production.

Errors use [RFC 9457 Problem Details](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9457) with a machine-readable `code`:

```json
{
  "detail": "This verification request has already been reviewed",
  "instance": "/api/admin/kyc/4021630a-51e9-447e-afd6-355d60ae9339/approve",
  "status": 422,
  "title": "Unprocessable Content",
  "code": "KYC_ALREADY_REVIEWED"
}
```

Lists accept `page`, `size` (max 100) and `sort` (e.g. `sort=createdAt,desc`) and return `content`, `page`, `size`, `totalElements`, `totalPages`.

"Signed in" endpoints work before email verification; every other non-public endpoint also requires a verified email. "Wallet holder" means a merchant or a KYC-approved client. "API key" endpoints are called by a merchant's server with the `X-API-Key` header instead of a session cookie.

## Rate limiting

Sensitive endpoints allow 10 requests per minute for each client address and endpoint. A blocked request returns `429` with a `Retry-After` header and the code `TOO_MANY_REQUESTS`.

| Limited | Endpoints |
| --- | --- |
| Every request | register, login, verify email and resend, forgot/reset/change password, top-ups, transfers, recipient lookup and suggestions, PDF receipts and statements, seeding and demo data clean-up |
| Writes only | payment requests (create, pay, decline, cancel), API keys, merchant payments, gateway calls and checkout payments |

## Payment gateway

A merchant accepts wallet payments in four steps:

1. Create an API key under **API keys** in the merchant dashboard (or `POST /api/merchant/api-keys`). The full key is returned once; only its SHA-256 hash is stored.
2. The merchant's server creates a checkout session for an order:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.almotawaj.com/api/gateway/checkout-sessions \
  -H "X-API-Key: almt_..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"orderReference":"ORDER-1042","amount":12.500,"description":"2 x Arabic coffee beans"}'
```

3. The response contains `checkoutUrl`. The merchant sends the customer there; the customer signs in and pays from their wallet.
4. The merchant confirms the result with `GET /api/gateway/checkout-sessions/{sessionId}` before fulfilling the order.

| Status | Meaning | Next |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PENDING` | Waiting for the customer, for 30 minutes | `PAID`, `CANCELLED`, `EXPIRED` |
| `PAID` | Money moved from the customer to the merchant | `REFUNDED` |
| `CANCELLED` | Cancelled by the merchant | – |
| `EXPIRED` | Not paid in time | – |
| `REFUNDED` | The full amount moved back to the customer | – |

An API key only opens `/api/gateway/**`; it cannot read the wallet or any other endpoint. Without a valid key the gateway answers `401`.

## PDF documents

Receipts and statements are generated by the API with OpenPDF and an embedded DejaVu Sans font, so they look the same on every device. The `Accept-Language` header (`en` or `ar`) chooses the language; Arabic documents are laid out right-to-left. A statement accepts the same filters as the transaction list, shows the totals of everything that matches and lists at most the 500 newest transactions.

## Live notifications

`GET /api/notifications/stream` is a Server-Sent Events stream for the signed-in wallet holder. Events are sent only after the database transaction commits.

| Event | Sent to | Payload |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `money-received` | the receiver of a top-up or transfer | `amount`, `senderName`, `reference` |
| `payment-requested` | the payer of a new payment request | the payment request |
| `payment-request-updated` | both sides when a request is created, paid, declined or cancelled | the payment request |
